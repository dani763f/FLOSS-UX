# Resource and Project Management in FLOSS

One of the categories to emerge from the findings has to do with the handling of resources, the project management being done and how decisions are reached, executed and conceptualized for further development. Also uncovered here was the distribution of different roles in the projects, and the varying skill sets that came to light in the discussions with the project members.
