    "content": "# Design in FLOSS projects This project is dedicated to **improving, educating and creating discussion** for the benefit of everyone interested in software that resides in the realm of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). What does it take to create user experiences that rival proprietary software with huge budgets and design teams? Let's figure it out as a community, through discussion and cooperation! {: .fs-6 .fw-300 } --- ## Why this project? **Design work in FLOSS is a unique problem**. Design activities take a lot of time and require unique skills. This becomes a problem when most of the people in FLOSS are developers who don't always have the necessary education, interest or resources to support design activities. The need to support FLOSS communities with these decisions has existed since the inception of FLOSS and in some ways even before that [(Norman, 1981)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/202165676_The_trouble_with_UNIX_The_user_interface_is_horrid). Since then the notion that FLOSS software is hard to use and developed for power users has existed and still thrive to this day. This seems to hint at the fact that this issue is harder to tackle than one might assume, and that it requires a lot of discussion and recontextualization of mindsets in these communities that are creating extremely powerful software that is available to everyone around the world. ## The Study This format and the content on this page is built on a study of two FLOSS projects that while vastly different in terms of size and goals have interesting similarities and serve as a great way to kick start discussions on the subject. Additionally, some of the findings from previous studies are also distilled into easily accessible considerations to avoid the barrier that is reading and understanding. ## How does it work? This page is intended as the \"frontend\" of the projects corresponding GitHub page. The process is designed to work as follows. 1. Anyone can create a discussion suggesting a new addition to these pages. This can be commenting on what's already there, possible solutions or something else that the FLOSS practitioner in question finds relevant. 2. The results or notions from the discussion are formulated into a pull request, proposing the change needed to the existing files or new files being created from the discussion 3. The pull request is merged and the change is reflected on the content of the site. The intention is that this pattern repeats itself which will make this site a living, changing and fully free/libre documentation for everyone wanting to enrich their user experiences in their respective projects.
